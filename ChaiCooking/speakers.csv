"0","Dr Gabrielle Walker",,,"The world is facing systemic challenges on an unprecedented scale. And yet many of our institutions – both public and private – are trapped in silos and increasingly driven towards short-term and short-sighted goals. Dr Gabrielle Walker works at the boundaries between silos and sectors, brokering new kind of collaborations and conversations that aim to help increase our strategic time horizon, understand better the challenges, and generate effective, system-wide, solutions.
She is an expert strategist, speaker and moderator, helping businesses to address global challenges—with a focus on sustainability, new energy and climate change. She works at boardroom-level with a wide range of global companies to analyze emerging global trends, challenge conventional thinking and turn innovative ideas into action. She has covered many different sectors including: oil and gas, utilities, renewable energy, finance and investment, consumer goods, retail, risk management, certification and professional services.
Gabrielle gives keynote addresses to corporate audiences around the world. She is also an accomplished moderator of high-level debates, guiding panels involving global CEOs, former heads of state, government ministers, military generals and global humanitarian leaders. She has extensive experience at designing and facilitating innovative “safe-space” conversations between global leaders, from small round tables through to major international meetings. Gabrielle has presented many TV and radio programs for the BBC.
She has been Climate Change Editor at Nature and Features Editor at New Scientist and has written very extensively for many international newspapers and magazines, including The Economist, Prospect, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. She is author of four books including co-authoring the bestselling book The Hot Topic, how to avoid global warming while still keeping the lights on, which was described by Al Gore as “a beacon of clarity” and by The Times as “a material gain for the axis of good”. She has a PhD from Cambridge University and has taught at both Cambridge and Princeton Universities.
A self-confessed “ice addict” Gabrielle has made more than a dozen trips to both poles. She has also climbed trees in the Amazon rainforest, swum with piranhas, been sneezed on by a humpback whale, hooked lava out of a live volcano, and flown in zero gravity.","0",,"gabrielle.png"
